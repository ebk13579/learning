# Description

Want to get up and running with building and consuming GraphQL APIs? In this course, Building Scalable APIs with GraphQL, you'll learn what separates GraphQL from other languages and API runtimes, like REST APIs, as well as what problems GraphQL solves, and how to use it for declarative data communication. This course is a good place to start for learning GraphQL, but to get the most from this course, you should have some experience with JavaScript and with databases, like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. You'll learn how to create a GraphQL schema and how to use it via any interface, including an HTTP-based one. You'll learn about the different features of the GraphQL language as well as how to build them in a GraphQL server. Next, you'll learn to use multiple databases with GraphQL, how to model relationships between different entities and collections, and how to use caching and batching via tools like Dataloader to avoid extra queries to the database and to solve problems like the N+1 queries problem. Finally, you'll learn how to work with promises, mutations, union types, and how to use database views with GraphQL. By the end of this course, you'll know how to build and consume a GraphQL API, and how to do so efficiently.
